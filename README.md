# Strava-API-Data-Evaluation

This project focuses on data collected from the Strava API, an application that creates unique tracking activities for atheletes. It contains a wide range of information about the atheletes activity statistics. My partner and I used this to our advantage in order to answer questions about atheletes. By coding in Python and R and using statistical hypothesis testing, we were able to answer if men or women work out more "intensly" and which country has the most "efficient" workout.
